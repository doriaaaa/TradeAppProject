Most of them after finishing the course will just simply throw the textbooks away as they have no one to pass them on to. It will become a waste of paper and money since those books are quite thick and consumed lots of paper to print instead. To address the waste and encourage students in CUHK to meet each other, we decided to develop an application, which lets people trade stuff that they won't need for something useful while promising them social interactions, letting them have a chance to meet some new friends."),
